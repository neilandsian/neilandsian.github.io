  <h1>Wedding FAQs</h1>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2><span class="emoji">🎁</span>Are you doing a gift list or anything?</h2>
    <p>Nope—we don’t want presents. We’re just really happy to have you there with us. We know it costs money to travel, take time off, and get to the (slightly) middle of nowhere, and that’s more than enough of a gift already.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2><span class="emoji">👗</span>Is there a dress code?</h2>
    <p>Not really. Wear whatever you’ll feel happiest in at a wedding. If that’s a suit, great. If it’s something comfy you can dance in, also great. Maybe don’t wear a bridal gown—but that’s about our only rule.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2><span class="emoji">⏰</span>What time’s the ceremony?</h2>
    <p>The ceremony’s at 12:30pm, but please aim to arrive between 11:00 and 12:00. We’re staying on-site (along with a bunch of others), so there’ll be people around from Friday night if you turn up early. Arriving in good time means you can say hi, find a seat, and not burst in mid-vows like an unexpected plot twist.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2><span class="emoji">⚖️</span>Is it a legal ceremony?</h2>
    <p>Yep, it’s the real deal. So when they say “speak now…”, please don’t—it makes things awkward and paperwork-y.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2><span class="emoji">🍖</span>What’s happening on Friday?</h2>
    <p>We’re having a BBQ from 6pm onwards—come hungry! We’ve got a bunch of drinks (some alcoholic, some not), but if you’ve got specific drink preferences, feel free to BYOB.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2><span class="emoji">🗺️</span>Where is it?</h2>
    <p>It’s all happening at Northside Farm, Horsley, NE15 0LZ. It’s not remote-remote, but give yourself a little time just in case. There’s loads of parking once you arrive. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir//Northside+Farm,+Horsley+NE15+0LZ/@55.0012921,-1.9444034,12z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x487ddbcf505ab397:0x4e3c8d772456f63!2m2!1d-1.8620034!2d55.0013199?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" target="_blank">Get directions</a></p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2><span class="emoji">🍕</span>What’s happening on Sunday?</h2>
    <p>We’ll be around all day, taking it easy—probably a film on the projector, definitely pizzas. Dungarees are strongly encouraged. Come chill in your comfies. It’s the bonus level.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2><span class="emoji">🍳</span>What’s the deal with breakfast?</h2>
    <p>On Saturday morning, we’ll have bread, milk, cereal, and tea/coffee—help yourself, and bring anything extra if you’re feeling fancy. On Sunday, there’ll be a cooked breakfast provided, no effort required. Just turn up hungry.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2><span class="emoji">🏕️</span>What’s it like staying on site?</h2>
    <p><strong>Whether you’re in a pod, a tent, or a campervan, you’ll have access to the Stable</strong>, which has:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A washing-up area and laundry facilities</li>
      <li>Four proper bathrooms with showers, toilets, and sinks</li>
      <li>Baby-changing stations and baby baths for kids who hate showers</li>
      <li>A shared kitchen with fridge, cooker etc. (you know what a kitchen is)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Pods also have:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lighting, heating, a plug socket</li>
      <li>Fridge, kettle, and microwave</li>
      <li>Beds for up to 5 — the venue doesn’t provide bedding or towels, but we can. So if you understandably don’t fancy hauling a duvet across the country, just let us know—we’ve got spares.</li>
    </ul>
